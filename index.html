 <h1 id="greet">Hello World!!!</h1>
  <p id="anything">Javascript is another type of coding language that is used to develop apps and webpages. CSS is used to decorate the website and the visual attributes but the Javascript is used to make the program interactive. An example of this would be clicking a button to make something happen. What we did today was Java Script where we created buttons on our webpage to change it's physical attributes. We created buttons to turn the webpge into darkmode, to change font color and to change font style. We used tags, functions and events that are connected on each file to make it interactive, to design it and to state it's function. On the index.html we states the function, while on CSS we decorated the button that was used, and on the script.js file we made the button interactive. </p>
  <button onclick="paragraph()">change style</button>
  <button onclick="myfunction()">Click Here</button>
  <button onclick="night()">dark mode</button>
  <script src="script.js"></script>
